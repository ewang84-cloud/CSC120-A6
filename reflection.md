What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Unit testing is a pretty fun process!! I like reading the codes and thinking about what it meant to have in the beginning, what are the results of the method, is there anything going run, etc. But it does feel a little bit funny that in this assignment in order to do it quicker I'm looking for the bug at first and then writing the testor instead of the opposite which makes more sense. But anyways, it's fun
